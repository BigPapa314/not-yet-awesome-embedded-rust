## The List Template

Here's an example for something that is not yet awesome:

### It's Hard to Foo without a Bar

#### Background

[IETF RFC -1](#) states that you should be able to Foo with either a Bar, Bib, Bim, or Bap. However in all of [these](#) [rust](#) [crates](#), you're required to have a Bar!

#### Success Criteria

I'd like to be able to Foo using **only** a Bib, Bim, or Bap.

#### Work in progress

* The [foobar](https://crates.io/crates/foobar) has [Issue #1337](#) open to add support for Foo-ing with a Bim or Bap.
